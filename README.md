## Project Overview

This repository contains a Stock Price Trend Prediction system using Bidirectional LSTM networks. It enhances historical stock data with technical indicators (MA20, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) to forecast future stock prices. The Streamlit dashboard allows users to explore data, train models, and view forecasts interactively.
